    "field_description2": "This institute was held near the foundations of a raging waterfall, and it specialized in observing and researching Marine Biology. There's no discernible reason why Dr. Wily would choose to attack it of all places, but it was an adept location for a specialist swimmer like Bubble Man. Likewise, it would have the same effect on most Water and Nature robots that choose to fight here. It's imperative one doesn't mistake the Snappers for actual crabs; they're Mechas that'll soak any trespassers who come too close for comfort. Hidden within the waterfall itself, you might actually get a glance of what appears to be Wave Man. As someone looking for solitude, it seems the last place anyone would bother to look would be behind a torrent of water.",
