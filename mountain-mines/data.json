    "field_description2": "The Mountain Mines was Guts Man\u2019s scheduled workplace, but havoc was wrought when Dr. Wily maliciously programmed the robots of the area to allocate all its resources to him.  The mountainous region seems to reinvigorate Impact robots and Explode robots, but on the other end of the spectrum, Cutter robots perform quite poorly. The highly territorial Picket Men work constantly, all day and all night, breaking down minerals and warding off trespassers. Of course, as a place of work, there's always some spare time for play, so one may often see Hard Man and Guts Man at the local Karaoke bar.",
