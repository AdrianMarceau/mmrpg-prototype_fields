    "field_description2": "This field's entire existence in the Prototype is a mystery, as it has no real-life counterpart nor does it seem like it was ever coded in the first place. Thus, it's a contamination of the entire system, emanating the source of whatever infliction has infiltrated the Prototype. In a last-ditch effort to defend itself, the mysterious contamination surprisingly replicates the strongest force currently available in the Prototype; the teams of the doctors! These hollow sigma copies have no reservations against using any and every advantage available on hand, so the doctors have to do the same to succeed and escape! Security Beaks are the primary mechas whose purpose is to root out any intruding malware, and as a source field in the Prototype, every single Mecha's data can be loaded and summoned on this field. With the hope of the world on their shoulders, this is the final destination and the final battle. Fight, our heroes, for everlasting peace!",
