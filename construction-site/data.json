Cutter and Earth typed attacks perform admirably here, but the same can't be said for any time-manipulation attacks. The hedgehog-like Needle Neds roll around and occasionally fire off piercing conical projectiles, and they look absolutely adorable doing so. The cargo nets have occasionally been known to get caught into tangled knots, so when they just can't be salvaged, Blade Man is usually called upon to simply slice the whole thing off -- he'd like to try to untangle them himself, but he doesn't quite have the hands for it.",
